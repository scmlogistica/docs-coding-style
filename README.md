[Naming convention][1] is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing programmers to choose any character sequence) include the following:
 - To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;
 - To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
 - To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.
